Disclaimer: These projects showcase my early attempts at programming as an absolute beginner and may not fully reflect my current abilities. They are provided solely as evidence of my basic understanding of the languages and technologies mentioned in the resume.

I'm unable to share my latest works due to an NDA, unfortunately. Nevertheless, I'd be happy to answer any non-sensitive questions about the project and demonstrate my knowledge through alternative means.
